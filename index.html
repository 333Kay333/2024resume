            Hello, my name is Kay Beachy, and I am a versatile professional with a diverse background in various career paths, including cosmetology, real estate, culinary arts, restaurant management, and wildlife conservation. However, my true passion lies in web development. I recently completed the SheCodes bootcamp, where I gained comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience as an entry-level full-stack web developer. With my certification in hand, I am eager to embark on my journey as a software engineer. Known for my strong work ethic and dedication, I thrive in challenging environments and enjoy tackling complex problems. I am driven by a genuine love for my work and find great satisfaction in creating innovative and user-friendly web solutions. I am excited to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team and make a meaningful impact in the world of web development.
